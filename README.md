# Description

This is a repository containing the code for A3: Modelling thin film optical filters using the transfer matrix method.

# Tasks

- [ ] Add the propagation matrix, unit test for it
- [ ] Add thhe transfer matrix, and unit test for it
- [ ] Create a wrapper which is able to hold the layers, and manage the transfer and propagation matrix calculations
- [x] Add a material properties database
	- [x] Create a functional way of finding materials in the Database.
	- [x] Use requirements for given datasets (both nk listed, given wavelength range, etc.)
	- [x] Add ways of getting data out for any wavelength by interpolation or, the given database formulae
